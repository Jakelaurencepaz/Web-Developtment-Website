            Now, in life there are plenty of things worth waiting for.<br />
            Your money isn't one of them. With Current, you can<br />
            get paid up to 2 days early, when you sign up for<br />
            direct deposit with your Current account.<br />

            <br />

            Current is a financial technology company<br />

        <h2><strong>How to get your<br /> pay check early:</strong></h2>

        <p>
            Download the Current app<br />
            from the App or Play Store. Your employer submits payroll of when/how much you should be paid.<br />

            <br />

            Sign up for a current<br />
            Account. Federal Reserve sends this information to Current.<br />

            <br />

            Email in direct deposit<br />
            through the Current app. Current credits your account immediately (up to two days early) vs. waiting for the specified date.

                    That's why, with a Current Account, early<br />
                    direct deposit is a feature we offer our<br />
                    members.<br />

                    <br />

                    In today's world, a lot can happen in 48<br />
                    hours. Being able to get paid early can be<br />
                    a critical tool in helping you live the way<br />
                    you want.

                </h4>

                <p>
                    We designed our banking system specifically<br />
                    so you can get paid up to two days early,<br />
                    as opposed to traditional banks. Normally,<br />
                    it's simply impossible to get your paycheck early,<br />
                    but with Current, you canâ€”even if "payday"<br />
                    is still a couple days out.<br />

                    <br />

                    Your life is unique, and we believe you<br />
                    deserve your hard-earned money as soon as possible.<br />
                    Direct deposit up to two days early is<br /> 
                    something we're proud to offer our members.
